I'm a graduate student from College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University. My research interest includes computer vision, 3D reconstruction, generative models, and medical data process.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Jiajun Bu and Haishuai Wang of EAGLE Lab from College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University.
